## Operator Packages and Documentation

These packages can be used along with the `@can/it-core` package or its utilization packages mentioned below.

- **[@can-it/operators-relation](./packages/operators/relation/):** Provides a relational matching comparator and its generator.
  [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@can-it/operators-relation.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@can-it/operators-relation)

  For example, your system can allow the `edit` action to perform the `view` action. Accessing `settings` can also grant access to `payments` and `profiles`.

  For example, your system can allow access to all members in any organization by defining the value as `organizations::*::members`. Accessing members of organization A will have the value `organizations::A::members`.
